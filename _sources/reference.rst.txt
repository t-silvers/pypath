Reference
=========

How to navigate the reference?
------------------------------

We don't compile a table of contents for the reference as that would be huge.
Instead, you can click on the module, class and function names in the tables
until you reach the actual documentation page of the function or object that
you are interested in.

   :template: custom-module-template.rst
